# Pokedex
Pokedex using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, tried to make an index of all the pokemons with their respective information, using the PokeAPI.

## How to use it
Open live server to view it in your browser. then either type a number or name of a pokemon in the search bar and press enter or click the search button.

## What I learned
I learned how to use the fetch API to get data from the PokeAPI and how to use async/await to get the data from the API and then use it in my code. I also learned how to use the filter method to filter through an array of objects and return the object that matches the condition.

## What I would like to add
I would like to add a way to search for a pokemon by type, and also add a way to search for a pokemon by its evolution chain.

## What I would like to change
I would like to change the way the pokemon are displayed, I would like to display them in a grid instead of a list, and I would like to add a way to display the pokemon's evolution chain.
